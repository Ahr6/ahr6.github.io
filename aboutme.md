---

My name is Aleksander Ramirez. I went the majority of my life without learning two fundamental skills, sewing and coding. This is problematic because I have many friends who can either sew or code, and my inability forced me to miss out on many fun opportunities to sew or code with them. However, now that I am taking e-textiles, I will finally be able to join my friends when they go to sewing or coding events. This will result in me having a more enjoyable college experience. It will furthermore allow me to engage in coding and sewing projects in my own time that will certainly also be enjoyable.

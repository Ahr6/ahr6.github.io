My name is Aleksander Ramirez. I am a first year, class of 2026. I am a prospective History and Political Science major. I also love studying French, Spanish, and Latinx Studies. I have no prior sewing experience, and I have minimal programming experience. I took a minecraft coding class 7 years ago, and haven't coded since. In this class I am excited to learn how to sew and I hope that I learn enough about the basics of coding to hopefully take at least one more Computer Science class in the next four years. One boring fact about me is that I like playing Chess.

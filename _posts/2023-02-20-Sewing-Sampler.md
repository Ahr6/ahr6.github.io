One tip that I learned is that it can be helpful to watch multiple videos or scroll through articles multiple times before actually sewing to guarantee that you understand the motions before trying it. It helped me a lot when I could fully conceptualize the sewing technique before sewing instead of just jumping in and trying to figure it out.

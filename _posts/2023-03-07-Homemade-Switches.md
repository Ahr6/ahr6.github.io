For this project I had to make two different kinds of homemade switches. I chose to make one that completes the circuit when a paperclip is folded over, and another that turns on when two pieces of connective thread touch. 

One tip that I learned was to really think through the paper prototype because it made the actual sewing a lot easier because I had a good reference point and I didn't have to redo anything.

Aleks' anti-theft backpack is a revolutionary leap forward in the backpack industry. Backpack wearers have long been plagued by concerns that their values can be stolen literally behind their backs. No longer! With my backpack, the moment a would-be thief even opens the bag a red light turns on and the buzzer sounds, alerting you to the crime. 

When the switch is off and the backpack is closed the light and buzzer stay off. When the switch is on and the backpack is closed both stay off. However, when the switch is on, and the backpack is open, a red LED turns on and the buzzer sounds. 

My fear of having my most valuable possession, my laptop, stolen from my bag without me noticing motivated me to create this project. 

The material list for this project included 2 Lilypad red LEDs, 1 sparkfun usb plus hub, 1 switch, 1 light sensor, 1 buzzer, conductive thread, thread, needles, scissors, felt, and a backpack.

3 tips to myself:

1st tip is to go to more TA office hours. The TAs were always super helpful and even when projects went well I regretted not going to their help-hours.

2nd tip is to refer back to the slides more often. Although the slides rarely overlap directly with projects, they always provide helpful insights that helped me with my homework.

3rd tip is to practice the stitches from the beginning of the class more. Sewing is a great skill to have and practicing helped me make basic stitches much quicker. 

No additional ressources were used for this project.

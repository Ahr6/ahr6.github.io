This was an assignment where I had to write code that gave me clothing recommendations based on the current temperature outside (in degrees farenheit). 

One tip that I would give my past self while completing this assignment is to debug smaller lines of code instead of trying to run it all at once because it was a little overwhelming to see all the little mistakes that I made.

For this assignment I had to write a program that gives a read out of the status of LED lights depending on whether or not a button is pressed and a switch is flipped. When both the button is pressed and the switch is on, all 3 LEDs should read as on.

One tip I would give myself is to start this assignment earlier because it was stressful to do at the last minute.

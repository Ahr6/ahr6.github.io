For this project I had to prototype and then actually make a felt plushy with three LEDs that light up when a switch is turned on and a buton is pressed.

One tip that I found helpful was to use a needle or the thread to make the necessary connections before I actually sewed them in just to double check that I was sewing the wiring in the correct order. I had to pull out some stitches because I sewed in the wrong order and I think this could have saved me some time.
